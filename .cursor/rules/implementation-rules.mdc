# Implemenation rules

- Always work from the [implementation-plan.md](mdc:development-docs/implementation-plan.md) and update the file with any changes you have made, ensuring they are checked. 
- Always follow the [design-system.md](mdc:development-docs/design-system.md) and use [app-prd.mdc](mdc:.cursor/app-prd.mdc) to understand the outline of the project. 
- Always read from [implementation-progress.md](mdc:development-docs/implementation-progress.md) to know how things have been done, and update it to describe your changes.
